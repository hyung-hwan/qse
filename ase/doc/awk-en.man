.title ASEAWK

== ASEAWK ==
ASE provides an embeddable interpreter of a dialect of the AWK programming language. The language implemented is slightly different from {the version developed by Brian W. Kernighan, http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/index.html} and has been adjusted to the author's preference.

=== User Guide ===

The embedding of the interpreter is best described in the same source code available in the distribution.
