See the Manual file for documentation.

This release also has a Perl version, perlisp, contributed by the Perl
Avenger, who writes:

  It has new primitives: a reentrant "load", a "trace" command, and more
  error reporting.  Perlisp will attempt to load a program called
  "testme" before anything else, when it runs.  After that, it will load
  $HOME/.perlisprc if that file exists, before reverting to the
  interactive read/eval/print loop.

The awk code is still essentially the code posted to alt.sources (May
31, 1994), but with a garbage collector added.
