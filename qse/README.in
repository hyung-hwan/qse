The QSE library implements AWK, SED, and other Unix commands in an embeddable 
form and defines data types, functions, and classes that you can use when you 
embed them into an application. It also provides more fundamental data types 
and functions needed when you deal with memory, streams, data structures. The 
interface has been designed to be flexible enough to access various aspects of
embedding application and an embedded object from each other.
