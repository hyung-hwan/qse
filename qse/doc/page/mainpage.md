The QSE library implements AWK, SED, and Unix commands in an embeddable form 
and defines data types, functions, and classes that you can use when you embed 
them into an application. It also provides more fundamental data types and 
funtions needed when you deal with memory, streams, data structures.
The interface has been designed to be flexible enough to access various 
aspects of embedding application and an embedded object from each other. 

The library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3:
