@section INTRODUCTION

QSE provides a script engine for various scripting languages and utility programs. It aims to produce a flexible script engine framework that can be embedded into an application. A hosting application can access various aspects of the embedded script engine and vice versa.

The library is licended under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

@section installation INSTALLATION

@subsection build_from_source BUILINDG FROM A SOURCE PACKAGE

The package uses the standard autoconf build systems. Briefly, you can run 
@b configure and @b make to compile and install it. Here is the simple 
instruction.

Download the latest source package from:
- http://code.google.com/p/qse/downloads/list

Unpack the package and run @b configure and @b make to compile and install it:

@code
$ ./configure
$ make	
$ make install
@endcode

For additional command line options to @b configure, run @b configure @b --help.

@subsection crosscompile_win32 CROSS-COMPILING FOR WIN32

While the package does not provide any build files for native WIN32 compilers,
you can cross-compile it for WIN32 with a cross-compiler. Get a cross-compiler 
installed first and run @b configure with a host and a target.

With MINGW32, you may run @b configure as shown below:

@code
$ ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc 
$ make
$ make install
@endcode

The actual host and target names may vary depending on the cross-compiler 
installed.

@subsection mchar_mode MULTI-BYTE CHARACTER MODE

By default, the package is compiled for wide character mode. However, 
you can compile it for multi-byte character mode by running @b configure 
@b --disable-wchar.

@code
$ ./configure --disable-wchar
$ make
$ make install
@endcode

Under the multi-byte character mode:
- #QSE_CHAR_IS_MCHAR is defined.
- #qse_char_t maps to #qse_mchar_t.

Under the wide character mode:
- #QSE_CHAR_IS_WCHAR is defined.
- #qse_char_t maps to #qse_wchar_t.

#qse_mchar_t maps @b char and #qse_wchar_t maps to @b wchar_t or equivalent.
It is not advised to build the package for both modes and have them installed
on the same system as doing so results in name collision.

@section MODULES
The package contains a set of APIs. Each set is organized into a library 
module and its interface is exported via relevant header files.

- @subpage awk "AWK Interpreter"
- @subpage sed "SED Stream Editor"
