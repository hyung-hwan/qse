/** @mainpage QSE

@section INTRODUCTION

@b QSE is a code library that implements various Unix utilities in an 
embeddable form and provides a set of APIs to embed them into an application. 
The APIs have been designed to be flexible enough to access various aspects of 
a hosting application and an embedded object from each other. By embedding 
a Unix utility into an application, a developer is relieved of problems caused
by interacting with external programs and is given tighter control over it.

Currently the library implements the following utilities:
- @subpage sed "SED Stream Editor"
- @subpage cut "CUT Text Cutter"
- @subpage awk "AWK Interpreter"

As the library grows, more utilities will be added.

The library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3:

@section installation INSTALLATION

@subsection build_from_source BUILINDG FROM A SOURCE PACKAGE

The package uses the standard autoconf build systems. Briefly, you can run 
@b configure and @b make to compile and install it. Here is the simple 
instruction.

Download the latest source package from:
- http://code.google.com/p/qse/downloads/list

Unpack the package and run @b configure and @b make to compile and install it:

@code
$ ./configure
$ make	
$ make install
@endcode

For additional command line options to @b configure, run @b configure @b --help.

@subsection crosscompile_win32 CROSS-COMPILING FOR WIN32

While the package does not provide any build files for native WIN32 compilers,
you can cross-compile it for WIN32 with a cross-compiler. Get a cross-compiler 
installed first and run @b configure with a host and a target.

With MINGW32, you may run @b configure as shown below:

@code
$ ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc 
$ make
$ make install
@endcode

The actual host and target names may vary depending on the cross-compiler 
installed.

@subsection mchar_mode MULTI-BYTE CHARACTER MODE

By default, the package is compiled for wide character mode. However, 
you can compile it for multi-byte character mode by running @b configure 
@b --disable-wchar.

@code
$ ./configure --disable-wchar
$ make
$ make install
@endcode

Under the multi-byte character mode:
- #QSE_CHAR_IS_MCHAR is defined.
- #qse_char_t maps to #qse_mchar_t.

Under the wide character mode:
- #QSE_CHAR_IS_WCHAR is defined.
- #qse_char_t maps to #qse_wchar_t.

#qse_mchar_t maps @b char and #qse_wchar_t maps to @b wchar_t or equivalent.

@section library_modules LIBRARY MODULES
@b QSE contains a set of APIs. Each set is organized into a library module 
and its interface is exported via header files.  Commonly used functions and 
data structures are organized into a common functions library and forms the 
foundation for other modules. Specialized functions and data structures are
organized to dedicated modules.  See relevant subpages for more information 
on each module.

- @subpage cmn "Common Functions"
- @subpage sed "SED Stream Editor"
- @subpage cut "CUT Text Cutter"
- @subpage awk "AWK Interpreter"
