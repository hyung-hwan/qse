/** @mainpage QSE

@section qse_intro INTRODUCTION

The QSE library implements functionality of various Unix commands in an 
embeddable form and defines data types, functions, and classes that you can 
use when you embed such functionality into an application. The interface has
been designed to be flexible enough to access various aspects of embedding 
application and an embedded object from each other. 

Currently the library contains the following components:
- @subpage awk "AWK Interpreter"
- @subpage cut "CUT Text Cutter"
- @subpage sed "SED Stream Editor"

As the library grows, more components will be added.

The library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3:

@section installation INSTALLATION

@subsection build_from_source BUILINDG FROM A SOURCE PACKAGE

The package uses the standard autoconf build systems. Briefly, you can run 
@b configure and @b make to compile and install it. Here is the simple 
instruction.

Unpack the latest source package downloaded from:
- http://code.google.com/p/qse/downloads/list

Alternatively, you can check out the lastest source code from the subversion 
repository by executing the following command:
- svn checkout http://qse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/qse/ 

Run @b configure and @b make to compile and install it:

@code
$ ./configure
$ make	
$ make install
@endcode

For additional command line options to @b configure, run @b configure @b --help.

@subsection crosscompile_win32 CROSS-COMPILING FOR WIN32

While the package does not provide any build files for native WIN32 compilers,
you can cross-compile it for WIN32 with a cross-compiler. Get a cross-compiler 
installed first and run @b configure with a host and a target.

With MINGW32, you may run @b configure as shown below:

@code
$ ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc 
$ make
$ make install
@endcode

The actual host and target names may vary depending on the cross-compiler 
installed.

@subsection mchar_mode MULTI-BYTE CHARACTER MODE

By default, the package is compiled for wide character mode. However, 
you can compile it for multi-byte character mode by running @b configure 
@b --disable-wchar.

@code
$ ./configure --disable-wchar
$ make
$ make install
@endcode

Under the multi-byte character mode:
- #QSE_CHAR_IS_MCHAR is defined.
- #qse_char_t maps to #qse_mchar_t.

Under the wide character mode:
- #QSE_CHAR_IS_WCHAR is defined.
- #qse_char_t maps to #qse_wchar_t.

#qse_mchar_t maps to @b char and #qse_wchar_t maps to @b wchar_t or equivalent.

@section library_modules LIBRARY MODULES
@b QSE contains a set of APIs. Each set is organized into a library module 
and its interface is exported via header files.  Commonly used functions and 
data structures are organized into a common functions library and forms the 
foundation for other modules. Specialized functions and data structures are
organized to dedicated modules.  See relevant subpages for more information 
on each module.

- @subpage cmn "Common Functions" 
  -# xma.h variable-size block memory allocator
  -# fma.h fixed-size block memory allocator 
- @subpage awk "AWK Interpreter" 
- @subpage cut "CUT Text Cutter" 
- @subpage sed "SED Stream Editor"
