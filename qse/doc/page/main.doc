@section INTRODUCTION

QSE provides a script engine for various scripting languages and utility programs. It aims to produce a flexible script engine framework that can be embedded into an application. A hosting application can access various aspects of the embedded script engine and vice versa.

The library is licended under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

@section installation INSTALLATION

@subsection bulid_tarball_unix BUILINDG FROM A SOURCE TARBALL UNDER LINUX/UNIX

Download the latest source tarball from:
- http://code.google.com/p/qse/downloads/list

Unpack the tarball and run configure and make to compile it:

@code
$ ./configure
$ make	
$ make install
@endcode

To cross-comiple it for WIN32 with MINGW32, run configure as shown below:

@code
$ ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc 
$ make
$ make install
@endcode

@note For cross-compilation, get a cross-compiler installed first.

@subsection build_mchar BUILING FOR MULTI-BYTE CHARACTER MODE

The library can be built for two different character modes:
- multi-byte character mode
- wide character mode

Under the multi-byte character mode:
- #QSE_CHAR_IS_MCHAR is defined.
- #qse_char_t maps to #qse_mchar_t.
- #QSE_T("x") becomes "x".

Under the wide character mode:
- #QSE_CHAR_IS_WCHAR is defined.
- #qse_char_t maps to #qse_wchar_t.
- #QSE_T("x") becomes L"x".

Typically, #qse_mchar_t maps char and #qse_wchar_t is maps to wchar_t in both modes.

By default, the library is built for the wide character mode. To compile it
for the multi-byte character mode, run configure with the @b --disable-wchar option
specified explicitly.

@code
$ ./configure --disable-wchar
$ make
$ make install
@endcode
