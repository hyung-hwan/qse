@section INTRODUCTION

QSE provides a script engine for various scripting languages and utility programs. It aims to produce a flexible script engine framework that can be embedded into an application. A hosting application can access various aspects of the embedded script engine and vice versa.

The library is licended under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

@section installation INSTALLATION

@subsection bulid_tarball_unix BUILINDG FROM A SOURCE TARBALL UNDER LINUX/UNIX

Download the latest source tarball from:
- http://code.google.com/p/qse/downloads/list

Unpack the tarball and run configure and make to compile it:

@code
$ ./configure
$ make	
$ make install
@endcode

To cross-comiple it for WIN32 with MINGW32, run configure as shown below:

@code
$ ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc 
$ make
$ make install
@endcode

@note For cross-compilation, get a cross-compiler installed first.

@subsection build_mchar BUILING FOR MULTI-BYTE CHARACTER MODE

While the library is built for wide character mode by default, you can build
it for multi-byte character mode by running @b configure with the 
@b --disable-wchar option specified explicitly. 

@code
$ ./configure --disable-wchar
$ make
$ make install
@endcode

Under the multi-byte character mode:
- #QSE_CHAR_IS_MCHAR is defined
- #qse_char_t maps to #qse_mchar_t.
- #QSE_T("x") becomes "x"

Under the wide character mode:
- #QSE_CHAR_IS_WCHAR is defined
- #qse_char_t maps to #qse_wchar_t
- #QSE_T("x") becomes L"x"

Typically, #qse_mchar_t maps @b char and #qse_wchar_t maps to @b wchar_t or 
equivalent. It is not advised to build the library for both modes and have
them installed on the same system as doing so results in name collision.

@section MODULES
QSE includes various modules:
- @subpage awk "AWK"
- @subpage sed "SED"
