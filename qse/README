QSE is a code library that implements various Unix utilities in an
embeddable form and provides a set of APIs to embed them into an application.
The APIs have been designed to be flexible enough to access various aspects of
a hosting application and an embedded object from each other. By embedding
a Unix utility into an application, a developer is relieved of the need to
invoke an external command and is given tighter control over it.

Currently the library implements the following utilities:
- SED Stream Editor
- AWK Interpreter

As the library grows, more utilities will be added.

The library is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
